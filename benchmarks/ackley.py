        Ackley Function
        Global minimum: f(x) = 0 at x = [0, 0, ..., 0]
        Domain: Typically [-32.768, 32.768]
        Characteristics: Many local minima, with a large nearly flat outer region
        Useful for testing an algorithm's ability to converge to the global minimum despite local traps.
